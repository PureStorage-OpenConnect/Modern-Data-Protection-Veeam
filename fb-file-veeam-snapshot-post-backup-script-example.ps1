# Warning!!! This script will DESTROY snapshots.
# Use At Your Own Risk!

# This is an example post-backup script to provide some framework for allowing Veeam backup of FlashBlade file systems from snapshot
# Backing up shares/exports via snapshot provides for a consistent point in time and works around locked/open file issues
# While this is a fully functional script, it's intended as a starting point for someone with PowerShell skills to customize for use in their environment
# E.g. authentication can be done somewhat differently to obfuscate/secure credentials, error checking and logging may be modified/enhanced

# This script does the post-backup snapshot destruction, so that the snapshot created by pre-backup script doesn't live forever
# This example post-backup script will not attempt to eradicate the snapshot, so it will remain on the array for the duration of the eradication delay
# By default it will look for and destroy ALL snapshots matching the snapshot pattern used by the example pre-backup script
# That default pattern is the suffix "Veeam" followed by 14 digits representing the a timestamp down to the second

# Install PowerShell 7 to support FlashBlade PS module
# Install the FB module in pwsh for all users so that the Veeam service will be able to load it: Install-Module -Name PureFBModule -Scope AllUsers
# Then call this as a post-backup script in Veeam, and be sure to run it with PowerShell 7 e.g. like so:
#    "C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe" "<script_path>"

# Update the following variables appropriately:
$FlashBlade = "<FB_management_IP>"
$ApiToken = "<replace_with_valid_API_token"
$FileSystemName = "<name_of_FB_file_system>"
# The example value below is for a snapshot suffix matching "Veeam" followed by 14 numbers (timestamp down to seconds as used in example pre-script):
$SnapshotMatchPattern = 'Veeam\d{14}'

# Forcing script to require PowerShell v7:
#Requires -Version 7

# Logging details:
$InvokeTimestamp = Get-Date -UFormat "%Y%m%d%H%M%S"
